**Impact of Climate Change on European Countries**

Clustering Analysis: Assessing the Impact of Climate Change on European Countries
This project utilizes clustering techniques to evaluate the effects of climate change on various European countries. By categorizing these countries based on key climate indicators, geographical factors, and socio-economic impacts, the project seeks to uncover patterns and similarities in how different regions are influenced by climate change. This comprehensive analysis provides insight into the diverse challenges and opportunities faced by each country in responding to climate change, facilitating the development of tailored adaptation and mitigation strategies.

The table provided illustrates one of the clusters identified in the analysis, Cluster 1, which includes the following countries: Denmark, Sweden, Estonia, Cyprus, Finland, Latvia, Lithuania, Poland, Netherlands, Hungary, and Slovakia. The key metrics analyzed for each country are:

Temperature Increase: Indicates the rise in average temperatures, with Denmark experiencing the highest increase at 2.57°C, suggesting a significant warming trend.

Precipitation Changes: Shows variations in precipitation, with some countries like Denmark and the Netherlands experiencing reductions, potentially leading to drought conditions.

Maximum Temperature Anomaly: Reflects the extent of temperature extremes, with Estonia showing a notable anomaly of 1.92°C.

Maximum Rainfall and Drought Indicators: These metrics highlight changes in rainfall patterns and drought severity, crucial for understanding water resource challenges.

Heat Wave Occurrences: Although the cluster shows minimal heat wave frequency, this metric is essential for assessing health and environmental risks.

Coast Length and Sea Level Rise: Denmark has the longest coastline in this cluster, making it highly susceptible to sea level rise, which is most pronounced in Cyprus with an increase of 100 cm.

Average Elevation: This factor influences a country's vulnerability to sea level rise, with low-lying areas like the Netherlands and Denmark being particularly at risk.

Overall, this analysis aids in identifying common and unique vulnerabilities among European countries, providing a foundation for collaborative regional strategies and targeted national policies to combat and adapt to the impacts of climate change.
